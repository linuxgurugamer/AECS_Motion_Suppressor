This mod disables and re-enables your control surfaces on atmosphere exit/ re-entry to stop your SSTOs from helplessly flapping their wings in space.

You can also disable and enable the control surfaces manually.

New features include the automatic disabling of engine gimbaling when the engines are not running, and the addition of air brakes to the surfaces being controlled

Depends on Module Manager

TODO
	Have control surface or engine slowly move to center when disabled
