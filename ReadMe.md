This mod disables and re-enables your control surfaces on atmosphere exit/ re-entry to stop your SSTOs from helplessly flapping their wings in space.

You can also disable and enable the control surfaces manually.

New features include the automatic disabling of engine gimbaling when the engines are not running, and the addition of air brakes to the surfaces being controlled

Depends on Module Manager

TODO
	Have control surface or engine slowly move to center when disabled

------------

This mod is derived from the old Control Surface Toggle mod.  original thread is here:  https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/164626-*

Immersion gets shattered when you are in space and your control surfaces flap uselessly while maneuvering.  Also, it's quite funny when you are on a planet with an SSTO which has airbrakes, and the airbrakes open when you hit the brakes.  

What really annoys me is the useless engine gimbaling when I'm just rotating the vessel, etc.  Also disables engine gimbaling when fuel flow is 0 (ie:  engine not running).

This mod fixes all that, seamlessly and automatically.  For those who want to, you can manually disable/enable all control surfaces by right-clicking on one of the parts.  There are now events, so you can also do that using action groups
